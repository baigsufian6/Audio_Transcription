## How It Works
---------------

### 1. **Audio Recording**
The user can click the **Start Recording** button to begin recording audio using their *microphone*. The **MediaRecorder API** is utilized to capture the audio directly in the browser.

### 2. **Audio Playback**
After the user stops recording, the audio is played back in the browser using the `<audio>` HTML element, allowing users to hear their recorded message.

### 3. **Audio Transcription**
The recorded audio is uploaded to **Cloudinary** and a transcription request is made to the **AI Transcriptions API** to convert the audio to text.

### 4. **Display Transcription**
Once the transcription is completed, the text is displayed in real-time on the interface.
